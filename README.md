This is just a repo I made so I can back up and properly version assets I make for my Blender work. I'm making this public so that others might benefit from it at some point potentially. Everything I have the rights to that I upload here is distributed under CC0 license, meaning it is in essence public domain and may be used for anything by anyone for any reason in any way with or without modification and with or without crediting me. There may be some stuff uploaded here for which I am not the license-holder or not the sole license-holder, in which case those licensing terms are not applicable, but generally this will just be stuff I've made for my own uses rather than commissioned stuff or derivative works from existing properties. When in doubt, ask, but if you're sure, go forth and do stuff.
